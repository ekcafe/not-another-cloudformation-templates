# Not-Another-CloudFormation-Templates

Not-Another-CloudFormation-Templates is a repository that contains a collection of sample AWS CloudFormation templates to provision AWS resources in real-life scenarios which occasionally do not fit the baseline template samples given by AWS.

The goal is to help lower the barrier of entry into the world of AWS. However, some of these templates may also benefit veteran AWS engineers as well. I recommend that you use these templates as a starting point for creating your own templates as it is nearly impossible to cover every single deviation of the templates to fit everyone's use case. 

Before launching the template, it is recommended that you always review the resource that the template will create, know the estimate cost and permission it requires.

Most of the template were developed with security in mind and most of them are incorporated with security best practice as recommended by AWS and/or thier trusted technology partners along with protection for emerging threats.

# About the Repository

The repository contains sample template for an individual AWS service or a solution which involves multiple AWS services
